👥 HR Financial, Attrition & Work-Life Balance Dashboards (Power BI & Tableau)
📁 Overview

The dashboards help HR professionals and top management understand employee attrition patterns, financial compensation trends, and work-life balance challenges.

🎯 Intended Audience
HR Managers

Department Heads

C-Level Executives

Operational Managers

These dashboards provide actionable insights to improve employee retention, adjust salary structures, and promote work-life balance initiatives.

🧠 Story Behind the Data
The dashboards simulate a real-world HR challenge: A large company with 1,470 employees is seeing rising attrition, especially among younger and single employees. The dashboards were designed to answer key questions:

Why are certain departments losing more employees?

How does tenure affect salary and retention?

What role does work-life balance play in attrition?

Are specific demographics more affected?

🔍 Key Insights
Employees with fewer years at the company earn lower salaries and are more likely to leave.

High attrition in Sales and R&D departments points to workload and satisfaction issues.

Poor work-life balance strongly correlates with higher attrition.

Job level 3 has higher workload and attrition rates.

Gender imbalance exists at top job levels (e.g., Job Level 5: 19 males, 7 females).

✅ Suggested Actions from Dashboard Insights
Improve promotion and career development opportunities.

Introduce retention strategies for high-attrition roles.

Launch diversity initiatives to correct gender imbalances in top roles.

Reevaluate compensation for roles with high attrition and low income growth.

Roll out flexible work, wellness programs, and mental health support.

Investigate attrition causes in younger and single employee segments.

Allocate resources to high-attrition departments (Sales, R&D).

Improve recruitment to ensure job-role alignment.
